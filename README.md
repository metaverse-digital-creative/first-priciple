> 機器人出去上班 · 替老闆賺錢 — Robot Deployment Command Center

**The 113KB brain finally has hands.**

## What This Is

A deployment command center that turns robot-as-a-worker strategy into revenue. 5 panels, one mission: make money first, compound toward the platform.

## Panels

| Panel | Purpose | Bottleneck It Solves |
|---|---|---|
| **DEPLOY** | 5-step factory onboarding wizard | "How do I start?" |
| **EARN** | Real-time robot earnings dashboard | "Is this making money?" |
| **ENGAGE** | Desire Engine loop runner | "How do I keep the boss hooked?" |
| **COMPOUND** | Deployment learning tracker | "What did we learn?" |
| **PITCH** | Visual ROI proposal generator | "How do I close the next deal?" |

## Run

```bash
open index.html
```

No framework. No npm. No build step. Opens in browser, works on factory floor.

## First Principles

1. Start with the thing that makes money fastest
2. Identify the biggest cost/bottleneck
3. Vertically integrate that one thing
4. Use that control to make everyone else dependent on you
5. Turn the dependency into a platform

## Origin

Built by stripping 21 Antigravity IDE projects to their atoms and extracting only what ships revenue.
