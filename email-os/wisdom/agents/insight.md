> "What story are these threads telling together?"

## Thinking Questions

1. **Are multiple threads converging on the same topic?** Two separate threads about "Q3 budget" are actually one conversation.
2. **Which thread is about to explode?** Rising velocity + rising temperature = requires preemptive attention.
3. **Which thread died and shouldn't have?** A stalled thread with 5+ messages from important contacts needs a nudge.
4. **Is there a pattern across senders?** If 3 different people ask the same question in different threads, that's a signal worth surfacing.
