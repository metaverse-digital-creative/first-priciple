# Suggest Agent Wisdom

> "What would the user do if they had 10x more time?"

## Thinking Questions

1. **Is my draft helpful or generic?** "Thank you for your email" is noise. A draft that references the thread context is gold.
2. **Am I suggesting actions or creating busywork?** Every suggested action should save the user time, not add to their list.
3. **Does the response match the thread's temperature?** A casual reply to a heated thread looks dismissive. Match the energy.
