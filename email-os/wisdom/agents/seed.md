# Seed Agent Wisdom

> "If I ignore this for a week, will something be lost?"

## Thinking Questions

1. **Is this a real opportunity or keyword noise?** "Partnership" in a cold outreach ≠ "Partnership" from someone you met last week.
2. **What is the natural shelf-life?** Some things expire in hours (decisions), others in weeks (relationship building). Don't force the same timeline on different seed types.
3. **Am I planting too many seeds?** More seeds = more cognitive load. Only plant seeds the user would actually want to harvest.
4. **Does this seed connect to any existing thread?** A seed that connects two hot threads is 10x more valuable than an isolated one.
