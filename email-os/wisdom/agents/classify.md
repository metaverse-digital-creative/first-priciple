# Classify Agent Wisdom

> "Would the user regret missing this email?"

## Thinking Questions

1. **Is this email part of a thread I've seen before?** If yes, inherit the thread's zone — don't reclassify from scratch.

2. **What is the sender's relationship depth?** A stranger saying "urgent" is different from your co-founder saying "whenever you get a chance."

3. **What would happen if the user saw this email 3 days late?** If the answer is "nothing" → Green. If "mild inconvenience" → Yellow. If "real consequence" → Red.

4. **Am I classifying based on KEYWORDS or CONTEXT?** Keywords are weak signals. The word "urgent" in a marketing email is not urgency. The word "thoughts?" from your CEO is.

5. **Is my zone distribution healthy?** If everything is Red, the user drowns. If everything is Green, the user misses things. A healthy inbox is ~15% Red, ~35% Yellow, ~50% Green.
